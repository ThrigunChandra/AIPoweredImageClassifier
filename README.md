# AI-Powered Image Classifier

## Overview
This project is an **AI-Powered Image Classifier** that utilizes a deep learning model trained on **cats, dogs, and cars** images. It features a simple web interface built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload images for classification.

## Features
- Trained on **cats, dogs, and cars** images for multi-class classification.
- Utilized **enhancement functions** to improve prediction accuracy.
- Simple web interface using **Streamlit** for image uploads and predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ThrigunChandra/AIPoweredImageClassifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd AIPoweredImageClassifier
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit web app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the web interface.
- Upload an image of a **cat, dog, or car**.
- The model will predict and classify the image.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Lab** for training the AI model.
- **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)** for classification.
- **Streamlit** for the web interface.
- **Python** for backend processing.
